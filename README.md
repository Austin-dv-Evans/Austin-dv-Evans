# Austin Evans 
#### Full Stack Developer, Denver Colorado


Thanks for checking out my GitHub. I am a full stack developer. My family just got a little bigger and my work just got a lot cooler. Formally a bartender, event producer and one hell of a funky Dj I have spent the last 8 months learning how to code. Inspired by the upcoming addition of Luna my first child I decided it was time for a career change and I couldn't have picked a better one. I am a Flatiron bootcamp grad and I haven't stopped learning since. As a full stack engineer you have to have a lot of skills. I aim to be the swiss army knife of software engineers.
