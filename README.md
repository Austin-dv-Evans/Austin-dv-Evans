### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my GitHub. My name is Austin, I am full stack developer in Denver, Colorado. I love building projects, collaborating with other developers and taking ideas and turning them into tangible applications. I am an up-beat and energetic guy. I am a father, husband and a super funky DJ. I am currently searching for my next role! If you have a freelance project in mind or a job opportunity please feel free to contact me! Thanks so much!
