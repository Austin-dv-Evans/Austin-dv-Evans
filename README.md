# Austin Evans 
#### Full Stack Developer, Denver Colorado


Thanks for checking out my GitHub. I am a full stack developer passionate about music, my family and everything that is React! I am an up-beat and energetic guy. I am currently mastering complex concepts such as state management with Redux and Context Api, as well as Compound Components and Component Architecture. Searching for my first full time role has been tough but I know someone out there is going to be very pleased when they give this, passionate, hard worker a chance. If you have an app we can build or a job opportunity please contact me! Thanks so much!
