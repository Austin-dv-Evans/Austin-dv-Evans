# Austin Evans 
#### Full Stack Developer, Denver Colorado


Thanks for checking out my GitHub. I am a full stack software developer! 


Formally a bartender, event producer and one hell of a funky Dj, I have spent the last 10 months learning how to code. 
Inspired by the upcoming addition of Luna, my first child, I decided it was time for a career change and I couldn't have picked a better one. 
I am a Flatiron bootcamp grad and I haven't stopped learning since.
As a full stack developer you need a lot of skills. Every day I am imporving my skills. 
I aim to be the swiss army knife of software engineers.
If you are looking for a dev that is just scratching the surface of his potential, you found him. 

My name is Austin
